SKU stands for **stock keeping unit**. It is a unique code that identifies a specific product or service in a store or catalog. It is often in the form of a machine-readable barcode or QR code that can be scanned to track the inventory, sales, and orders of the product or service.

SKUs are different from universal product codes (UPCs) or global trade item numbers (GTINs), which are standard and global codes that identify the type of product or service, but not the specific attributes or variations. For example, a UPC or GTIN can identify a pair of jeans, but a SKU can identify the brand, size, color, and style of the jeans.

SKUs are not regulated or standardized, so each vendor or retailer can create their own SKUs according to their needs and preferences. SKUs can help with inventory management, pricing, marketing, and customer service.
