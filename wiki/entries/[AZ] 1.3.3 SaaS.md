- Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective.
- Least flexible, easiest to set up.
- You get the max business value, as you only have to deal with data.
- **Customer Responsibilities** :
    - Data that is put into the system
    - Devices allowed to connect to the system
    - User access
- Everything else is cloud provider's responsibility.
- **Examples** :
    - Email and messaging.
    - Business productivity applications.
    - Finance and expense tracking.
    - Collaboration.
- Microsoft 365, Notion
