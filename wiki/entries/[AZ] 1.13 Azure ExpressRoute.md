###### Virtual Cross-Connection through a Connectivity Provider at a Colocation Facility
Let's break down the term "Virtual Cross-Connection through a Connectivity Provider at a Colocation Facility" to understand it better:

1. Virtual Cross-Connection: A virtual cross-connection is a logical connection between two or more entities within a colocation facility. It is called "virtual" because it doesn't involve a direct physical connection like traditional network cables. Instead, it relies on the underlying networking infrastructure provided by the connectivity provider.

2. Connectivity Provider: A connectivity provider is an organization or service provider that offers various network connectivity services. They may provide internet access, private network connections, cloud services, or other networking solutions.

3. Colocation Facility: A colocation facility, also known as a "carrier-neutral data center," is a data center facility where multiple organizations can rent space to host their servers, networking equipment, and other hardware. It allows businesses to have their infrastructure in a shared facility with advantages like improved security, power, cooling, and connectivity options.

Putting it all together, a "Virtual Cross-Connection through a Connectivity Provider at a Colocation Facility" means that within a colocation facility, a connectivity provider offers the ability to establish virtual network connections between different services or resources hosted in that facility. These virtual connections enable organizations to access a range of services without the need for dedicated physical links.

In practical terms, let's say Company A has its servers in a colocation facility, and they want to connect their servers to cloud services provided by Azure or other cloud providers. Instead of laying physical cables between their servers and the cloud provider's data center, they can establish a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider present in the colocation facility. This virtual connection enables seamless communication between Company A's servers and the cloud services, as if they were directly connected, but it is managed and facilitated by the connectivity provider and the colocation facility's networking infrastructure. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional physical connections for enterprises with diverse networking needs.

###### Even if you have an ExpressRoute connection, DNS queries, certificate revocation list checking, and Azure Content Delivery Network requests are still sent over the public internet.
Even if you have an ExpressRoute connection in place, certain types of traffic, such as DNS queries, certificate revocation list (CRL) checking, and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) requests, are still sent over the public internet rather than through the ExpressRoute connection. Let's break down what each of these means:

1. DNS Queries: Domain Name System (DNS) queries are requests made by your applications or devices to resolve domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. DNS is a fundamental protocol used on the internet to map human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses that computers can understand. In some cases, even if you have a private network connection like ExpressRoute, the DNS queries are still sent over the public internet to authoritative DNS servers to resolve the domain names.

2. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Checking: When a device or application needs to verify the authenticity of a digital certificate (e.g., SSL/TLS certificate used for secure communication), it checks the certificate's revocation status by consulting a CRL. The CRL contains a list of revoked certificates, and checking against it ensures the certificate hasn't been compromised or revoked. In certain scenarios, CRL checking may involve contacting publicly available servers on the internet, even if the primary data traffic is using ExpressRoute.

3. Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) Requests: Azure CDN is a global network of servers that caches and delivers content, such as images, videos, and web pages, closer to end-users to improve performance and reduce latency. While the content may be hosted on Azure services, the CDN requests might still traverse the public internet to reach the CDN servers before being served to end-users.

The reason for this separation of traffic is often related to the design and architecture of the internet and the specific services involved. In many cases, it's more efficient and faster to use the public internet for certain types of traffic that are widely distributed and don't require the direct path offered by ExpressRoute.

However, for other types of traffic like sensitive data transfers, accessing private resources, or maintaining a dedicated and secure connection to Azure services, ExpressRoute is still the preferred option, as it provides a private, direct, and more predictable connection between your on-premises network and Azure cloud services.
