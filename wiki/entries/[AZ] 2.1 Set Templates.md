+ refer to pre-defined configurations or blueprints that allow users to create consistent and standardized deployments of cloud resources. 
+ capture best practices, corporate standards, and regulatory requirements, enabling organizations to deploy resources in a compliant and consistent manner across their cloud environment.
+ key points and benefits:
	1. **Infrastructure as Code:** 
		+ Set templates are typically created using infrastructure as code (IaC) tools and languages, such as : 
			+ Azure Resource Manager Templates (ARM templates), 
			+ AWS CloudFormation, 
			+ or Google Cloud Deployment Manager. 
		+ These templates describe the desired state of the cloud infrastructure, including resources, configurations, and dependencies.
	1. **Standardization:** 
		+ Set templates provide a way to enforce standardization and consistency in resource deployments. 
	2. **Reusability:** 
		+ Templates can be reused across different deployments, saving time and effort in creating and configuring resources manually. 
		+ This reusability promotes consistency and reduces the risk of configuration errors or omissions.
	1. **Automation:** 
		+ Set templates enable automation of resource deployments. 
	1. **Auditability and Compliance:** 
		+ By using set templates, organizations can demonstrate compliance and track changes effectively. 
		+ Templates capture the desired configuration state, making it easier to audit and verify compliance with regulatory requirements. 
		+ They also facilitate change management by providing a clear history of resource configurations and updates.
	1. **Collaboration and Governance:** 
		+ Set templates promote collaboration among teams by providing a common framework for resource deployments. 
		+ They enable centralized governance and control over resource provisioning, ensuring that all deployments adhere to defined standards and policies.
