###### Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):

- VMs provide IaaS in the form of a virtualized server.
- VMs provide an abstraction layer/ virtualization for CPU, memory, and storage that can be changed without having to invest in new hardware, while still allowing the environment to be flexible and secure.
- They virtualize the hardware.
- Customizable with different operating systems (OS) and software.
- Azure Virtual Machines are designed to run a single virtual machine instance per user. Each VM is dedicated to an individual user or workload.

###### Provisioning Azure VMs:
- provisioning refers to the process of creating and setting up the necessary resources and infrastructure required to deploy a VM or other computing resources
- Creation options: from scratch or using preconfigured VM images.
- Preconfigured VM images are templates with pre-installed OS and software. 
- Images don't have hardware configs, user has to do it themselves.
- Rapid provisioning in minutes using preconfigured VM images.
- Configurable with desired settings like development tools or web hosting environments.

###### Scaling VMs in Azure:

- Single VMs: suitable for testing, development, or smaller workloads.
- Grouping VMs: enables high availability, scalability, and [[[AZ] 2.0 Important Terms|redundancy]].
- The following are logical groups, not physically separate groups.
- **Virtual Machine Scale sets:** 
	- Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update groups of identical, load-balanced VMs in minutes.
	- When you have a load-balanced VM setup, incoming network traffic is directed to a load balancer, 
		- which then distributes the traffic across the VM instances in the group.
		- to ensure even distribution and efficient utilization of resources
	- Automatic scaling based on demand or defined schedule.
	- Automatic deployment of load balancers for efficient resource utilization.
	- VM scale sets can be used to build large-scale services for areas such as 
		- compute, 
		- big data,
		- container workloads.
- **Virtual Machine Availability Sets:**
	- Improving VM resiliency and availability in Azure.
	- VM availability sets stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing VM downtime due to a single point of network or power failure.
	-   In Azure, when you deploy virtual machines (VMs) within an availability set, they are automatically assigned to different update domains and fault domains.
	- **Update domains**:
		- The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time.
		- groups VMs for staggered updates, ensuring continuous availability.
		- An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.
		- By default, Azure ensures that VMs in an Availability Set are spread across up to three Fault Domains.
	- **Fault domains:** 
		- The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch.
		- This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains.
		- By default, Azure ensures that VMs in an Availability Set are spread across up to three Fault Domains.
	- No additional cost for configuring availability sets. Cost is incurred for created VM instances.

###### Use Cases for Azure VMs:

- **Testing and Development:**
	- Quick creation of VMs with different configurations (e.g. diff OS and app configs).
	- Easy deletion when no longer needed.
- **Running Applications in the Cloud:**
	- The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure to run them can provide substantial economic benefits.
		- the word "certain" implies that only specific applications can run in the cloud.
	- Scale VMs based on demand to optimize costs.
- **Extending On-Premises Networks:**
	- Extending the capabilities of its own on-premises network to create virtual networks in Azure and add VMs to the network.
	- Run applications like SharePoint on Azure VMs, instead of running locally.
- **Disaster Recovery:**
	- Use VMs in Azure as backup environment during primary datacentre failures.
- **Lift and Shift Migration:**
	- Migrate physical servers to Azure VMs with minimal changes.
	- Maintain responsibility for maintaining the installed OS and software.

###### VM Resource Configuration:

- **Size**: Determine purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM.
- **Storage Disks:** Choose between hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) etc.
- **Networking:** Configure virtual networks, public IP addresses, and port settings.

##### Advantages of VMs:

1. **Resource utilization and improved ROI:**
   - Multiple VMs can run on a single physical computer, allowing better utilization of hardware and maximizing return on investment.
   - return on investment (ROI)

2. **Scale:**
   - Cloud computing enables easy deployment of multiple copies of the same virtual machine to handle increased workload.

3. **Portability:**
   - VMs can be moved among physical computers in a network, allowing workload allocation based on available computing power.
   - VMs can also be migrated between on-premises and cloud environments, enabling hybrid cloud scenarios.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Creating a VM is faster and easier compared to installing an OS on a physical server.
   - VMs can be cloned with the OS already installed, allowing quick creation of new environments as needed.

5. **Security:**
   - VMs offer enhanced security compared to operating systems running directly on hardware.
   - VMs can be scanned for malicious software, and snapshots of VMs can be taken and restored if infected with malware.
   - VMs can be easily deleted and recreated to expedite recovery from malware infections.


##### VM use cases:

1. **Cloud computing:**
   - VMs have been the fundamental unit of compute in the cloud, enabling various applications and workloads to run and scale successfully.

2. **Supporting DevOps**:
   - VMs can be used to support enterprise developers by configuring VM templates with settings for software development and testing processes.
   - VMs can be created for specific tasks, such as static software tests, to streamline the DevOps toolchain.

3. **Testing a new operating system:**
   - VMs allow users to test-drive a new operating system on their desktop without affecting their primary OS.

4. **Investigating malware:**
   - VMs are useful for malware researchers who require fresh machines for testing malicious programs.

5. **Running incompatible software:**
   - VMs enable users to run software that is only available on a different operating system, providing compatibility solutions.
   - For example, running Windows in a VM on macOS allows access to software that is not available natively on macOS.

6. **Browsing securely:**
   - Using a VM for browsing provides a secure environment to visit websites without the risk of infection.
   - Snapshots of the VM can be taken and rolled back after each browsing session to maintain a clean state.

##### Downsides of VMs:

Additional downsides of VMs:

- VMs can only run one operating system at a time.

1. **Multiple Runtime Environments:**
   - If you have multiple server applications that require different runtime environments, such as different versions of programming frameworks or libraries, separate VMs are needed for each application.
   - This can lead to increased management complexity and resource overhead, as each VM runs its own operating system instance.	
   - **runtime environments** : such as different versions of programming languages or frameworks

2. **Resource Consumption:**
   - Running multiple VMs with separate operating systems consumes more resources, including CPU, memory, and storage.
   - This can result in higher costs and inefficient resource utilization, especially when the applications have varying levels of resource requirements.

3. **Start ups and Snapshot Time:**
   - VMs require the entire operating system to boot and initialize when started or when taking a snapshot.
   - This process can take several minutes, impacting the agility and responsiveness of the infrastructure.
   - It also increases the time required for tasks such as scaling or recovering from failures.
   - **snapshot** : a copy of the VM's state at a specific point in time
