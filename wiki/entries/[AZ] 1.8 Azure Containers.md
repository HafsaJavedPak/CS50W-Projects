- Containers are executable units of software in which application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that the code can be run anywhere—whether it be on desktop, traditional IT or the cloud.
- Azure supports several container variations, the most popular being [[[AZ-900] Docker|Docker]].
- Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering.
- Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service will run the containers for you.

#### Advantages of Containers

1. Size:
   - Containerized apps are smaller in size compared to VMs.
   - Containers share the host's operating system and libraries, reducing duplication.
   - Smaller size leads to more efficient resource utilization and faster deployment times.

2. Development Process:
   - Containers simplify the development process by providing a consistent runtime environment.
   - Developers can create a development environment that closely resembles the production environment.
	   - setting up a development environment that mimics the same configurations, dependencies, and settings as the actual production environment where the application or software will be deployed and used by end-users.
   - Applications and their dependencies can be packaged into a container image, facilitating reproducibility.

3. Orchestration:
   - Containers can be orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes.
   - Container orchestration enables efficient management of multiple containerized applications.
   - Automates tasks such as scaling, load balancing, and service discovery.

#### Benefits of Containers

Containers provide a level of abstraction that brings several benefits, particularly when compared to VMs:

1. Lightweight:
   - Containers share the host OS kernel, resulting in small container files and efficient resource usage.
   - Quick startup times and support for cloud-native applications that scale horizontally.

2. Portable and Platform-independent:
   - Containers encapsulate all dependencies, enabling consistent execution across different environments.
   - Applications can be written once and run without reconfiguration across various platforms.

3. Supports Modern Development and Architecture:
   - Ideal for DevOps, serverless, and microservices-based development and deployment.
   - Enables regular code deployments and incremental updates.

4. Improved Utilization:
   - Enhances CPU and memory utiliza1tion of physical machines.
   - Enables granular deployment and scaling of application components.



#### Use Cases for Containers

Containers are especially relevant in the following use cases:

1. [[[AZ-900] Containers and Microservices Architecture|Microservices]]:
   - Containers are well-suited for microservice architectures with loosely coupled and independently deployable components.
   - Each microservice can be packaged and deployed as a separate container.

2. DevOps:
   - Containers and microservices are commonly used in DevOps practices for building, shipping, and running software.

3. Hybrid, Multi-cloud:
   - Containers can run consistently across laptops, on-premises, and various cloud environments.
   - Ideal for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios, where organizations operate across multiple public clouds and their own data centres.

4. Application Modernization and Migration:
   - Containerization is a common approach to modernizing applications before migrating them to the cloud.

### Azure Container Instances
- Development team packages your application binaries and libraries into a container image.
- The image is the pushed to a repository, which can be public like Docker Hub, or it can be private like Azure Container Registry.
- Then using the Azure portal, you deploy these images from repositories to Azure Container Instances, which is **PaaS**.
- Azure Container Instances allow you to deploy containers and the service will run the containers for you.
- Some of _ACI_ **disadvantages** are:
	- Limited scalability – in terms of scaling up – ACI provides options to define resources allocated for a container. However, scaling out requires manual creation and management of ACI instances. It also does not provide _auto-scaling._

### Containerization 
Containerization is a modern software development approach that allows applications, along with their dependencies and configurations, to be packaged as self-contained units called container images. These container images can be tested, deployed, and run consistently across different environments, providing a standardized and efficient way to manage software.

Here's a detailed breakdown of each point:

1. **Package Together as Container Image**: Containerization involves bundling an application along with all the libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required to run it, into a single container image. This image is a lightweight, standalone, and portable package that can be easily distributed and deployed.

2. **Testing and Deployment as a Unit**: By packaging everything needed for the application in the container image, developers can ensure that the application works as intended and behaves consistently across different environments. The containerized application can be tested as a unit, meaning that developers can test the entire application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

3. **Isolation and Standardization**: Containers act as isolated units, providing a degree of separation between applications running on the same host. This isolation ensures that each application runs independently without interfering with others. Additionally, containers promote standardization by allowing developers to create container images with all the required components, making it easier to reproduce the same environment in different settings.

4. **Portability Across Environments**: Containerization facilitates the seamless movement of applications across various environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production. Since the container image encapsulates the application and its dependencies, it can be deployed consistently on any platform or cloud infrastructure that supports containers.

5. **Smaller Footprint than Virtual Machines**: Compared to traditional virtual machines, containers have a significantly smaller footprint. Containers share the host OS's kernel, which means they don't need to replicate the entire operating system like VMs do. This leads to faster startup times, reduced memory usage, and efficient use of resources.

6. **Docker and Container Host**: Docker is one of the most popular containerization platforms used to create, manage, and run containers. The "Docker host" mentioned in the example refers to the environment that supports running Docker containers. Each container runs on top of the Docker host, which itself runs on the host OS, whether it's Linux or Windows.

7. **Containerized Applications**: In the provided example, App1, App2, Svc1, and Svc2 represent containerized applications or services. These containers can run various types of applications, such as web applications, microservices, databases, etc. Since each container is self-contained, it can operate independently from other containers on the same host.

Overall, containerization revolutionizes software development and deployment by providing a more efficient and flexible way to build, test, and run applications across different environments, making it easier to manage complex software ecosystems.
