- difference between azure app service and containers???????????????????
- remember to look at the [azure app service pricing plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-t0mWW7X_s&list=PLl4APkPHzsUUOCWcjaXcH-WBVxCccZ4uO&index=12&ab_channel=TechTutorialswithPiyush)

###### Deployment and management are integrated into the platform." what does this point mean ?
This point means that Azure App Service provides a platform that handles the deployment and management of your application for you. You don’t have to worry about configuring the cloud infrastructure or the container orchestrators, as Azure App Service takes care of that for you. [You can use various features and tools provided by Azure App Service to build, deploy, and scale your web applications, such as load balancing, scaling, certificates, monitoring, etc.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment)

You can also use different deployment sources and mechanisms to deploy your application to Azure App Service, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, FTP, WebDeploy, etc. [You can also use continuous deployment to automatically pull the latest updates from your repository and deploy them to your web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-best-practices)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-best-practices). [You can also use deployment slots to deploy your app to a staging environment and validate your changes before swapping them to production](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/azure-devops-api-development/)[4](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/azure-devops-api-development/).

[Azure App Service simplifies the deployment and management of your web applications by providing a fully managed platform that integrates with other Azure services and supports various languages and frameworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)[5](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cloud-services/).



###### The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability"
in the context of Azure App Service, it means that App Service automatically distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of the application to ensure that if one instance becomes unavailable, the traffic will be redirected to other available instances. This distribution of traffic helps in load balancing and ensures that your application remains available and responsive even during surges in traffic or if one of the instances experiences issues. By managing the traffic across multiple instances, Azure App Service enhances high availability and provides a reliable environment for hosting your applications.





###### RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs are web services that use the HTTP protocol and the REST architectural style to exchange information between computer systems. [REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which means that each request or response contains a representation of the state of the resource (such as data or files) that you want to access or manipulate](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)[1](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/).

RESTful APIs are based on four main principles:

- Resources: Resources are the things that you want to access or manipulate through the API, such as users, products, orders, etc. Each resource has a unique identifier, usually a URL, that you can use to locate it.
- Methods: Methods are the actions that you can perform on the resources, such as create, read, update, or delete. The most common methods are GET (to retrieve a resource), POST (to create a new resource), PUT (to update an existing resource), and DELETE (to delete a resource).
- Representations: Representations are the formats that you can use to send or receive the state of the resources, such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc. The client and the server can negotiate the best representation for each request or response using the Content-Type and Accept headers.
- Stateless: Stateless means that each request or response is independent and does not depend on any previous or future ones. The server does not store any information about the client’s state or session. The client has to provide all the necessary information for each request, such as authentication tokens, parameters, etc.

RESTful APIs are preferred over other similar technologies because they use less bandwidth and are more suitable for efficient internet usage. [They also make it easier for developers to build and consume web services across different platforms and devices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-rest-api/)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-rest-api/)[3](https://blog.postman.com/understanding-api-basics-beginners/).

To get started on learning RESTful APIs, you will need to know some fundamentals:

- You will need to build an API in a programming language. [Simply understanding the foundations of JavaScript, for example, will be enough to prepare you to build and consume RESTful APIs](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/a-beginner-guide-to-restful-apis-with-thinkful)[4](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/a-beginner-guide-to-restful-apis-with-thinkful).
- You will need to use an HTTP client tool or library to make requests and receive responses from the API. [You can use tools like Postman, curl, or fetch to test and debug your API](about:blank#)[3](https://blog.postman.com/understanding-api-basics-beginners/)[5](https://medium.com/extend/what-is-rest-a-simple-explanation-for-beginners-part-1-introduction-b4a072f8740f).
- [You will need to follow some best practices and conventions when designing and documenting your API, such as using meaningful URLs, consistent methods and representations, proper status codes and error messages, etc.](about:blank#)[2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-rest-api/)[5](https://medium.com/extend/what-is-rest-a-simple-explanation-for-beginners-part-1-introduction-b4a072f8740f)

I hope this helps you understand what RESTful APIs are.😊


###### Swagger Support
Swagger support means that you can use Swagger tools to create and document your web APIs in a standard way. [Swagger is a set of tools that use the OpenAPI Specification, which is a common format for describing web APIs](about:blank#)[1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-swagger)[2](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/).

Swagger tools help you with the following tasks:

- Design and document your web APIs in a human- and machine-readable format, such as JSON or YAML.
- Generate interactive documentation, mock servers, client libraries, and test cases for your web APIs.
- [Collaborate with other developers and consumers of your web APIs](about:blank#)[1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-swagger)[3](https://www.javatpoint.com/swagger).

Swagger support also means that you can publish your web APIs in Azure Marketplace, which is a platform where you can find, try, and buy cloud software solutions from Microsoft and its partners. [By publishing your web APIs in Azure Marketplace, you can reach more customers and monetize your web APIs](about:blank#)[4](https://swagger.io/support/).


###### Web apps vs WebJobs
WebApps and WebJobs are both features of Azure App Service, but they have different purposes and use cases.

WebApps is a feature that enables you to create and host web applications, REST APIs, or microservices using various languages and frameworks. You can use WebApps to build and deploy your web app’s frontend and backend logic, user interface, and functionality. You can also use WebApps to integrate with other Azure services and features, such as authentication, SSL, custom domains, deployment slots, etc.

WebJobs is a feature that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app. You can use WebJobs to perform background tasks that support your web app’s logic or user interface, such as processing data, sending emails, or scheduling jobs. You can also use WebJobs to integrate with the Azure WebJobs SDK to simplify many programming tasks.

The main difference between WebApps and WebJobs is that WebApps is a way to create and host your web app itself, while WebJobs is a way to run a program or script as part of your web app. You can use both features together to enhance your web app’s functionality and performance. For example, you can use WebApps to create a web application that displays weather information, and use WebJobs to run a script that fetches the weather data from an external source periodically.

That’s one way to think of it, yes. WebApps is the main service that creates and hosts your web app, while WebJobs is an additional feature that runs a program or script to support your web app.



###### Web app vs Mobile Apps
The choice between WebApps and Mobile Apps depends on your app’s requirements and preferences. You can use either feature to create a backend for your iOS and Android apps, but they have different advantages and disadvantages.

WebApps is a more general and flexible feature that enables you to create and host web applications, REST APIs, or microservices using various languages and frameworks. You can use WebApps to create a web-based backend that hosts your app’s logic, functionality, and user interface. You can also use WebApps to integrate with other Azure services and features, such as authentication, SSL, custom domains, deployment slots, etc.

Mobile Apps is a more specific and specialized feature that enables you to create a mobile-specific backend that supports your iOS, Android, Xamarin, or React Native app. You can use Mobile Apps to create a REST API or a microservice that exposes your data and logic to your mobile apps. You can also use Mobile Apps to leverage mobile-specific features such as data sync, push notifications, offline access, etc.

Some of the factors that you may consider when choosing between WebApps and Mobile Apps are:

- The type of app you are building. If you are building a web app or a hybrid app that runs on both web and mobile platforms, you may prefer WebApps. If you are building a native mobile app that runs only on iOS or Android devices, you may prefer Mobile Apps.
- The features and tools you need. If you need various features and tools to build, deploy, and scale your web app or API, such as load balancing, scaling, certificates, monitoring, etc., you may prefer WebApps. If you need mobile-specific features and tools to enhance your mobile app’s user experience, such as data sync, push notifications, offline access, etc., you may prefer Mobile Apps.
- The level of control and customization you want. If you want more control and customization over your backend’s architecture, language, framework, and configuration, you may prefer WebApps. If you want more convenience and simplicity over your backend’s development and deployment, you may prefer Mobile Apps.

###### "The produced apps can be consumed from any HTTP- or HTTPS-based client"
This means that the web APIs that you build using Azure App Service can be accessed and used by any application or device that can send and receive HTTP or HTTPS requests and responses. HTTP and HTTPS are the protocols that are used to communicate over the internet. For example, a web browser, a mobile app, a curl command, or a Postman request can all be HTTP- or HTTPS-based clients that can consume your web APIs.



###### "You can use the WebJobs feature to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python, or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app."
In this paragraph, “in the same context” means that the WebJobs feature allows you to run a program or script in the same instance as your web app, API app, or mobile app. This means that the program or script shares the same resources and configuration as your app, such as the app settings, connection strings, environment variables, etc. [This also means that the program or script runs on the same pricing tier and scale settings as your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create).

Running a program or script in the same context as your app can have some advantages, such as:

- You don’t have to create a separate service or account to run your background tasks.
- You can use the same tools and languages that you use for your app development.
- [You can use the Azure WebJobs SDK to simplify your programming tasks and integrate with other Azure services](about:blank#)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-sdk-how-to).

However, running a program or script in the same context as your app can also have some disadvantages, such as:

- You may consume more resources and affect the performance of your app.
- You may encounter conflicts or errors if your program or script interferes with your app’s functionality.
- [You may have to deal with different deployment methods and lifecycles for your program or script and your app](about:blank#)[3](https://achrafbenalaya.com/2021/08/21/run-background-tasks-with-webjobs-in-azure-app-service/) . 

###### Mobile Apps
These points mean the following:

- Authenticate customers against common social providers, such as MSA, Google, Twitter, and Facebook: This means that you can use the Mobile Apps feature to enable your users to sign in to your app using their existing accounts from popular social media platforms, such as Microsoft, Google, Twitter, and Facebook. [This simplifies the authentication process and improves the user experience](about:blank#)[1](https://mindmajix.com/azure-app-services)[2](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/mobile).
- Send push notifications: This means that you can use the Mobile Apps feature to send messages or alerts to your users’ devices, even when your app is not running in the foreground. [Push notifications can help you engage your users, inform them of important events, or prompt them to take action](https://mindmajix.com/azure-app-services)[1](https://mindmajix.com/azure-app-services)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview). Push notifications are messages that pop up on your users’ devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or computers, even when they are not using your app or website
- SDK support: SDK stands for software development kit, which is a set of tools and libraries that help you develop applications for a specific platform or service. The Mobile Apps feature provides SDKs for native iOS and Android, Xamarin, and React Native apps. [You can use these SDKs to integrate your app with the Mobile Apps feature and access its capabilities, such as data storage, authentication, push notifications, offline sync, etc.](https://mindmajix.com/azure-app-services)[1](https://mindmajix.com/azure-app-services)[4](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-app-service-mobile-apps/).
