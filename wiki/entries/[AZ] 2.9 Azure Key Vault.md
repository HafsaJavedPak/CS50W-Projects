Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that allows you to securely store and access secrets, such as passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys. You can use it to protect your data and applications in Azure by encrypting them with keys that you control. You can also use it to manage the lifecycle of your keys, such as creating, importing, rotating, or backing them up¹.

Some of the benefits of using Azure Key Vault are:

- You can increase security and control over your keys and secrets by storing them in hardware security modules (HSMs) that are validated by FIPS 140-2 standards¹.
- You can reduce the complexity and cost of managing your own HSMs and key management software by using a cloud-based service that scales with your needs¹.
- You can monitor and audit your key and secret usage with Azure logging and integrate with your security information and event management (SIEM) solution¹.
- You can simplify and automate tasks related to SSL/TLS certificates by enrolling and renewing them from supported public certificate authorities¹.
